    "# Questions:\n",
    "**Model Setup**\n",
    "- What are sleepers modelling exactly? It's E modulus is not reflecting any of the given input parameters in the assignment.\n",
    "  R - The sleepers do correspond to the mass attached to the beam. The model should be completely setup, we can just run in and look into comparing with the ANSYS model\n",
    "- Are input parameters set correctly in the `get_input_hyper_loop.m` file?\n",
    "  - External Forces does not match given Dead Weight\n",
    "    R - The model should be completely setup, we can just run in and look into comparing with the ANSYS model\n",
    "  - Modulus of Elasticity of sleepers: there is extra coefficient 1.5?\n",
    "    R - The model should be completely setup, we can just run in and look into comparing with the ANSYS model\n",
    "  - Mass of sleeper does not match given Support Mass\n",
    "    R - The model should be completely setup, we can just run in and look into comparing with the ANSYS model\n",
    "  - From matlab plot it looks like the rail is not centered (this is reflected in the Mesh parameters, why do we do this?)\n",
    "    R - \"That should not matter, the sleepers only provide vertical support\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matlab file content**\n",
    "- How to read 'modal shape spectrum' graphs presented in the matlab script\n",
    "  R - Peaks correspond to the wavelength, we can zoom out for better readability. The purple curve is interrupted due to modelling parameters, but the peak should be at 320. \n",
    "- Are excercises at the bottom of `Assignment_problem_2024_Group2_Modified.mlx` to be carried out? They do not seem connected to our assignment\n",
    "  R - No, they are for student comprehension (not included in the assignment)\n",
    "- What is the difference between 'large scale' and 'small scale' Brillouin zones?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Exercises**\n",
    "- Question 2: Is this the correct acceleration plot? Should we infer the wavelength from this plot (periodicity is hard to see)\n",
    "  R - It is, the irregularity comes from \"imperfections probably being included in the model\". If we used a less stiff railpad we should be able to \n",
    "- Question 4: Isn't the current model already very stiff?\n",
    "  R - (A bit out of scope) If we lower the stiffness we expect the modal shapes to be more defined because the sleepers will 'absorb' the vibration.\n",

    "**PDF**\n",
    "- What sort of interpretation is to be given?\n",
